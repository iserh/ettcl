# Improved Explainability of Transformer based Text Classification through Late-Interaction

## Troubleshooting
If your getting cuda errors, make sure cuda is installed either system wide or by installing `cudatoolkit-dev` via conda. Also ensure to use a `gcc` version no later than 11.
```sh
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit-dev==11.7.0 gcc==11.3.0
```
